# Hackathon 4/21/17 WDI and UX/UI Students

I worked on this project with Jennifer Walters, Mary Buckingham, and Liron Mioni--all students at General Assembly Santa Monica's UX/UI immersive program. We had five hours to build a prototype app that answered the theme "Mixed Reality." 

Our app was "Respect Your Mother," a cleanup finder and creater designed to bring people together, reconnect with nature, and beautify patches of earth. I built our app in Ionic Creator and we demoed the project from my Iphone. We were able to present a (mostly) finished application because we focused on simplicity, utility, and a pain-free user experience.

We won the competition!
